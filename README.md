In this porject, I tried to use NewsAPI to stream news into a mySQL database.  
Then extract from mySQL database the columns needed in a pandas DataFrame.  
After that I tokenized the data and created a logistic regression classifier to predict fake news.  
The purpose was learning to interact with multiple libraries from jupyter notebooks, not to make a fine-tuned model.
